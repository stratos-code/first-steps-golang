# Challenge 21: Binary Search Implementation

## Problem Statement

Implement the binary search algorithm to efficiently find items in a sorted collection. Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that repeatedly divides the search space in half, making it much faster than linear search for sorted data.

You'll implement three versions of binary search:

1. `BinarySearch` - Standard binary search that returns the index of a target value.
2. `BinarySearchRecursive` - A recursive implementation of binary search.
3. `FindInsertPosition` - Find the position where a value should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

## Function Signatures
```
func BinarySearch(arr []int, target int) int
func BinarySearchRecursive(arr []int, target int, left int, right int) int
func FindInsertPosition(arr []int, target int) int
```

## Input Format
* For all functions, a sorted slice of integers arr and a target integer value.

* For the recursive function, additional left and right parameters indicating the search range.

## Output Format
* `BinarySearch` and `BinarySearchRecursive` should return the index of the target if found, or -1 if not found.

* `FindInsertPosition` should return the index where the target should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

## Requirements
1. All functions must implement the binary search algorithm, which has O(log n) time complexity.
2. The arrays can be assumed to be sorted in ascending order.
3. `BinarySearchRecursive` must use recursion to solve the problem.
4. If multiple occurrences of the target exist, return the index of any occurrence.
